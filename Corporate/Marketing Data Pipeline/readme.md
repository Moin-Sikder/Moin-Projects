## 🛠️ Development

Project Structure

```
├── main.go                 # HTTP server and routes
├── config/config.go        # Configuration settings  
├── models/models.go        # Data structures
├── processor/              # Data processing logic
│   └── data_processor.go
└── data/
    └── sample_logs.txt     # Sample marketing data
```

Adding New Features

· Modify models/models.go to add new data fields
· Update processor/data_processor.go for new calculations
· Extend the dashboard in main.go serveDashboard function

## ❓ Troubleshooting

Port already in use?

```bash
# Use a different port
PORT=8081 go run main.go
```

Dependencies not found?

```bash
go mod tidy
```

No data showing?

· Check that data/sample_logs.txt exists
· Verify the file format matches the examples

## 📈 Next Steps

Once you have the basic pipeline running, you can:

· Connect it to real ad platforms using their APIs
· Add database storage (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
· Implement user authentication
